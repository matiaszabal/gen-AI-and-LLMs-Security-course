# Generative AI and LLM Security: Engineering Resilient Systems

## Overview

This repository contains the structured curriculum and technical documentation for the **Generative AI and LLM Security** course. The program is designed to equip researchers and security engineers with the core principles, risk assessment frameworks, and defensive strategies required to secure Generative AI systems.

The curriculum covers the entire AI security spectrum—from **threat identification** and **adversarial attacks** to **LLM lifecycle protection**, **ethical compliance**, and **frontier threats** (Multimodal and Agentic AI). By the conclusion of this course, participants will be capable of detecting high-order vulnerabilities, implementing robust safeguards, and enforcing regulatory compliance in production-grade AI environments.

## Methodology and Educational Resources

### Assessment Framework

Each lesson is followed by a technical **Knowledge Check** and a **Practice Assignment**. These checkpoints are designed to reinforce theoretical concepts through applied security scenarios, ensuring the learner can transition from abstract principles to operational security.

### Supplementary Resources

* **Research Articles:** Curated list of whitepapers on adversarial robustness and LLM security.
* **Technical Guides:** Step-by-step documentation for deploying guardrails and monitoring systems.
* **Case Studies:** Retrospective analysis of real-world AI security breaches and successful mitigations.

### Collaborative Environment

Learners are encouraged to participate in peer-led discussions regarding:

* Optimization of LLM guardrails.
* Emerging trends in supply chain security.
* Ethical trade-offs in risk management.

Would you like me to generate a specific technical guide for the **Prompt Injection mitigation** section mentioned in Module 1 to include as a sub-document in this repository?
